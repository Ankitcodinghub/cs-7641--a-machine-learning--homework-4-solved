1. Two Layer Neural Network [65pts] **[P]****[W]**

Perceptron

A single layer perceptron can be thought of as a linear hyperplane as in logistic regression followed by a nonlinear activation function.

𝑑

𝑢𝑖 = ∑ 𝜃𝑖𝑗𝑥𝑗 + 𝑏𝑖

𝑗=1

𝑜𝑖 = 𝜙 𝜃𝑖𝑗𝑥𝑗 + 𝑏𝑖) = 𝜙(𝜃𝑇𝑖 𝑥 + 𝑏𝑖)

where 𝑥 is a d-dimensional vector i.e. 𝑥 ∈ 𝑅𝑑 . It is one datapoint with 𝑑 features. 𝜃𝑖 ∈ 𝑅𝑑 is the weight vector for the 𝑖𝑡ℎ hidden unit, 𝑏𝑖 ∈ 𝑅 is the bias element for the 𝑖𝑡ℎ hidden unit and 𝜙(. ) is a non-linear activation function that has been described below. 𝑢𝑖 is a linear combination of the features in 𝑥𝑗 weighted by 𝜃𝑖 whereas 𝑜𝑖 is the 𝑖𝑡ℎ output unit from the activation layer.

Fully connected Layer

Typically, a modern neural network contains millions of perceptrons as the one shown in the previous image. Perceptrons interact in different configurations such as cascaded or parallel. In this part, we describe a fully connected layer configuration in a neural network which comprises multiple parallel perceptrons forming one layer.

We extend the previous notation to describe a fully connected layer. Each layer in a fully connected network has a number of input/hidden/output units cascaded in parallel. Let us a define a single layer of the neural net as follows:

𝑚 demotes the number of hidden units in a single layer 𝑙 whereas 𝑛 denotes the number of units in the previous layer 𝑙 − 1.

𝑢[𝑙] = 𝜃[𝑙]𝑜[𝑙−1] + 𝑏[𝑙]

where 𝑢[𝑙] ∈ 𝑅𝑚 is a m-dimensional vector pertaining to the hidden units of the 𝑙𝑡ℎ layer of the neural network after applying linear operations. Similarly, 𝑜[𝑙−1] is the n-dimensional output vector corresponding to the hidden units of the (𝑙 − 1)𝑡ℎ activation layer. 𝜃[𝑙] ∈ 𝑅𝑚×𝑛 is the weight matrix of the 𝑙𝑡ℎ layer where each row of 𝜃[𝑙] is analogous to 𝜃𝑖 described in the previous section i.e. each row corresponds to one hidden unit of the 𝑙𝑡ℎ layer.

𝑏[𝑙] ∈ 𝑅𝑚 is the bias vector of the layer where each element of b pertains to one hidden unit of the 𝑙𝑡ℎ layer. This is followed by element wise non-linear activation function 𝑜[𝑙] = 𝜙(𝑢[𝑙]). The whole operation can be summarized as,

𝑜[𝑙] = 𝜙(𝜃[𝑙]𝑜[𝑙−1] + 𝑏[𝑙])

where 𝑜[𝑙−1] is the output of the previous layer.

Activation Function

There are many activation functions in the literature but for this question we are going to use Relu and Tanh only.

Relu

The rectified linear unit (Relu) is one of the most commonly used activation functions in deep learning models. The mathematical form is

𝑜 = 𝜙(𝑢) = 𝑚𝑎𝑥(0, 𝑢)

The derivative of relu function is given as 𝑜′ = 𝜙′(𝑢) = { 0 𝑢 ≤ 0

1 𝑢 &gt; 0

Tanh

Tanh also known as hyperbolic tangent is like a shifted version of sigmoid activation function with its range going from -1 to 1. Tanh almost always proves to be better than the sigmoid function since the mean of the activations are closer to zero. Tanh has an effect of centering data that makes learning for the next layer a bit easier. The mathematical form of tanh is given as

𝑒𝑢 − 𝑒−𝑢

𝑜 = 𝜙(𝑢) = 𝑡𝑎𝑛ℎ(𝑢) = −

𝑒𝑢 + 𝑒 𝑢

The derivative of tanh is given as

𝑜′ = 𝜙′(𝑢) = 1 − ( 𝑒𝑢 − 𝑒−−𝑢 )2 = 1 − 𝑜2

𝑒𝑢 + 𝑒 𝑢

Sigmoid

The sigmoid function is another non-linear function with S-shaped curve. This function is useful in the case of binary classification as its output is between 0 and 1. The mathematical form of the function is

1

𝑜 = 𝜙(𝑢) = −

1 + 𝑒 𝑢

The derivation of the sigmoid function has a nice form and is given as

𝑜′ = 𝜙′(𝑢) = 1 − (1 − 1 − ) = 𝜙(𝑢)(1 − 𝜙(𝑢))

1 + 𝑒 𝑢 1 + 𝑒 𝑢

Note: We will not be using sigmoid activation function for this assignment. This is included only for the sake of completeness.

Mean Squared Error

It is an estimator that measures the average of the squares of the errors i.e. the average squared difference between the actual and the estimated values. It estimates the quality of the learnt hypothesis between the actual and the predicted values. It’s non-negative and closer to zero, the better the learnt function is.

Implementation details

For regression problems as in this exercise, we compute the loss as follows:

1 𝑁

𝑀𝑆𝐸 = ∑ (𝑦𝑖 − 𝑦^𝑖)2

2𝑁

𝑖=1

where 𝑦𝑖 is the true label and 𝑦^𝑖 is the estimated label. We use a factor of 21𝑁 instead of 𝑁1 to simply the derivative of loss function.

Forward Propagation

We start by initializing the weights of the fully connected layer using Xavier initialization Xavier initialization (http://proceedings.mlr.press/v9/glorot10a/glorot10a.pdf). During training, we pass all the data points through the network layer by layer using forward propagation. The main equations for forward prop have been described below.

𝑢[0] = 𝑥

𝑢[1] = 𝜃[1]𝑢[0] + 𝑏[1]

𝑜[1] = 𝑇𝑎𝑛ℎ(𝑢[1]) 𝑢[2] = 𝜃[2]𝑜[1] + 𝑏[2]

𝑦 ̂ = 𝑜[2] = 𝑅𝑒𝑙𝑢(𝑢[2])

Then we get the output and compute the loss

1 ∑𝑁 ( ^)2

𝑙 =𝑦𝑖 − 𝑦𝑖

2𝑁

𝑖=1

Backward propagation

After the forward pass, we do back propagation to update the weights and biases in the direction of the negative gradient of the loss function. So, we update the weights and biases using the following formulas

[2] [2] ∂𝑙

𝜃 := 𝜃 − 𝑙𝑟 ×

∂𝜃[2]

𝑏[2] := 𝑏[2] − 𝑙𝑟 × 𝑙 ∂

∂𝑏[2]

∂ 𝜃[1] := 𝜃[1] − 𝑙𝑟 × 𝑙

∂𝜃[1]

𝑏[1] := 𝑏[1] − 𝑙𝑟 × 𝑙 ∂

∂𝑏[1] where 𝑙𝑟 is the learning rate. It decides the step size we want to take in the direction of the negative gradient.

To compute the terms ∂𝑙[𝑖] and ∂𝑙[𝑖] we use chain rule for differentiation as follows:

∂𝜃 ∂𝑏

So, ∂[𝑙2] is the differentiation of the loss function at point 𝑜[2]

∂𝑜

∂𝑜[2] is the differentiation of the Relu function at point 𝑢[2]

∂𝑢[2]

∂𝑢[[22]] is equal to 𝑜[1]

∂𝜃

∂𝑢[[22]] is equal to 1.

∂𝑏

To compute ∂𝑙[2] , we need 𝑜[2], 𝑢[2]&amp;𝑜[1] which are calculated during forward propagation. So we need to store

∂𝜃 these values in cache variables during forward propagation to be able to access them during backward propagation. Similarly for calculating other partial derivatives, we store the values we’ll be needing for chain rule in cache. These values are obtained from the forward propagation and used in backward propagation. The cache is implemented as a dictionary here where the keys are the variable names and the values are the variables values.

Also, the functional form of the MSE differentiation and Relu differentiation are given by

∂𝑙 ( [2] )

= 𝑜 − 𝑦

∂𝑜[2]

∂𝑙 ∂𝑙 [2] &gt; 0)

On vectorization, the above equations become:

∂𝑙

∂𝑜[2] 𝑛

∂𝑙 = 1 ∂𝑙 𝑜[1]

∂𝑙

∂𝑏[2] 𝑛 ∂𝑢[2]

This completes the differentiation of loss function w.r.t to parameters in the second layer. We now move on to the first layer, the equations for which are given as follows:

Where

𝑥

Note that ∂𝑜[[11]] is the differentiation of the Tanh function at 𝑢[1].

∂𝑢

The above equations outline the forward and backward propagation process for a 2-layer fully connected neural net with Tanh as the first activation layer and Relu has the second one. The same process can be extended to different neural networks with different activation layers.

Code Implementation:

∂𝑙

𝑑𝐿𝑜𝑠𝑠_𝑜2 =⟹ 𝑑𝑖𝑚 = (1, 379)

∂𝑜[2]

𝑑𝐿𝑜𝑠𝑠_𝑢2 = 𝑑𝐿𝑜𝑠𝑠_𝑜

𝑑𝐿𝑜𝑠𝑠_𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑡𝑎2 = 𝑑𝐿𝑜𝑠𝑠_𝑢

𝑑𝐿𝑜𝑠𝑠_𝑏2 = 𝑑𝐿𝑜𝑠𝑠_𝑢

𝑑𝐿𝑜𝑠𝑠_𝑜1 = 𝑑𝐿𝑜𝑠𝑠_𝑢

𝑑𝐿𝑜𝑠𝑠_𝑢1 = 𝑑𝐿𝑜𝑠𝑠_𝑜

𝑑𝐿𝑜𝑠𝑠_𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑡𝑎1 = 𝑑𝐿𝑜𝑠𝑠_𝑢

𝑑𝐿𝑜𝑠𝑠_𝑏1 = 𝑑𝐿𝑜𝑠𝑠_𝑢

Note: Training set has 379 examples.

⟹ 𝑑𝑖𝑚 = (1, 379)

⟹ 𝑑𝑖𝑚 = (1, 20)

⟹ 𝑑𝑖𝑚 = (1, 1)

⟹ 𝑑𝑖𝑚 = (20, 379)

⟹ 𝑑𝑖𝑚 = (20, 379)

⟹ 𝑑𝑖𝑚 = (20, 13)

⟹ 𝑑𝑖𝑚 = (20, 1)

Question

In this question, you will implement a two layer fully connected neural network. You will also experiment with different activation functions and optimization techniques. Functions with comments “TODO: implement this” are for you to implement. We provide two activation functions here – Relu and Tanh. You will implement a neural network that would have tanh activation followed by relu layer.

You’ll also implement Gradient Descent (GD) and Batch Gradient Descent (BGD) algorithms for training these neural nets. GD is mandatory for all. BGD is bonus for undergraduate students but mandatory for graduate students.

We’ll train this neural net on boston house-prices dataset. Graduate students have to use both GD and BGD to optimize their neural net. Undergraduate students have to implement GD while BGD is bonus for them. Note: it is possible you’ll run into nan or negative values for loss. This happens because of the small dataset we’re using and some numerical stability issues that arise due to division by zero, natural log of zeros etc. You can experiment with the total number of iterations to mitigate this.

You’re free to tune hyperparameters like the batch size, number of hidden units in each layer etc. if that helps you in achieving the desired MSE values to pass the autograder tests. However, you’re advised to try out the default values first.

Deliverables for this question:

1. Loss plot and MSE value for neural net with gradient descent

2. Loss plot and MSE value for neural net with batch gradient descent (mandatory for graduate students, bonus for undergraduate students)

2: (Bonus for all) Image Classification based on Convolutional

Neural Networks [15pts] **[W]**

Keras is a deep learning API written in Python, running on top of the machine learning platform TensorFlow. It was developed with a focus on enabling fast experimentation. Being able to go from idea to result as fast as possible is key to doing good research. In this part, you will build a convolutional neural network based on Keras to solve the image classification task for CIFAR10. If you haven’t installed TensorFlow, you can install the package by pip command or train your model by uploading HW4 notebook to Colab (https://colab.research.google.com/) directly. Colab contains all packages you need for this section.

Load CIFAR10 dataset

We use CIFAR10 dataset to train our model. This is a dataset of 50,000 32×32 color training images and 10,000 test images, labeled over 10 categories. Each example is 32 × 32 pixel color image of various objects.

In [8]: # Helper function, You don’t need to modify it

Load some images from CIFAR10

As you can see from above, the CIFAR10 dataset contains selection of objects. The images have been sizenormalized and objects remain centered in fixed-size images.

Build convolutional neural network model

In this part, you need to build a convolutional neural network as described below. The architecture of the model is:

[INPUT – CONV – CONV – MAXPOOL – DROPOUT – CONV – CONV – MAXPOOL – DROPOUT – FC1 DROPOUT – FC2]

INPUT: [32 × 32 × 3] will hold the raw pixel values of the image, in this case, an image of width 32, height 32, and with 3 color channels. This layer should give 16 filters and have appropriate padding to maintain shape.

CONV: Conv. layer will compute the output of neurons that are connected to local regions in the input, each computing a dot product between their weights and a small region they are connected to the input volume. We decide to set the kernel_size 3 × 3 for the both Conv. layers.

For example, the output of the Conv. layer may look like [32 × 32 × 32] if we use 32 filters. Again, we use padding to maintain shape.

MAXPOOL: MAXPOOL layer will perform a downsampling operation along the spatial dimensions (width, height). With pool size of 2 × 2, resulting shape takes form 16 × 16.

DROPOUT: DROPOUT layer with the dropout rate of 0.25, to prevent overfitting.

CONV: Additonal Conv. layer take outputs from above layers and applies more filters. The Conv. layer may look like [16 × 16 × 32]. We set the kernel_size 3 × 3 and use padding to maintain shape for both Conv. layers.

CONV: Additonal Conv. layer take outputs from above layers and applies more filters. The Conv.

layer may look like [16 × 16 × 64].

MAXPOOL: MAXPOOL layer will perform a downsampling operation along the spatial dimensions (width, height).

DROPOUT: Dropout layer with the dropout rate of 0.25, to prevent overfitting.

FC1: Dense layer which takes input above layers, and has 256 neurons. Flatten operations may be useful.

DROPOUT: Dropout layer with the dropout rate of 0.5, to prevent overfitting.

FC2: Dense layer with 10 neurons, and softmax activation, is the final layer. The dimension of the output space is the number of classes.

Activation function: Use LeakyReLU unless otherwise indicated to build you model architecture.

Note that while this is a suggested model design, you may use other architectures and experiment with different layers for better results.

You now need to set training variebles in the init() function in cnn.py. Once you have defined variables you may use the cell below to see them.

Batch Size : 64

Epochs : 10

Learning Rate : 0.001

Defining model

You now need to complete the create_net() function in cnn.py to define your model structure. Once you have defined a model structure you may use the cell below to examine your architecture.

In [15]: # Helper function, You don’t need to modify it

Tuning: Training the network is the next thing to try. You can set your parameter at the Defining Variable section. If your parameters are set properly, you should see the loss of the validation set decreased and the value of accuracy increased. It may take more than 30 minutes to train your model.

Expected Result: You should be able to achieve more than 80% accuracy on the test set to get full 15 points. If you achieve accuracy between 75% to 79%, you will only get half points of this part.

3: Random Forests [40pts] **[P]** **[W]**

NOTE: Please use sklearn’s DecisionTreeClassifier in your Random Forest implementation. You can find more details about this classifier here. (https://scikit-

learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeClassifier.html#sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeClassifier_)

3.1 Random Forest Implementation (30 pts) **[P]**

The decision boundaries drawn by decision trees are very sharp, and fitting a decision tree of unbounded depth to a list of examples almost inevitably leads to overfitting. In an attempt to decrease the variance of a decision tree, we’re going to use a technique called ‘Bootstrap Aggregating’ (often abbreviated ‘bagging’). This stems from the idea that a collection of weak learners can learn decision boundaries as well as a strong learner. This is commonly called a Random Forest.

We can build a Random Forest as a collection of decision trees, as follows:

1. For every tree in the random forest, we’re going to

a) Subsample the examples with replacement. Note that in this question, the size of the subsample data isequal to the original dataset.

b) From the subsamples in a), choose attributes at random to learn on in accordance with a providedattribute subsampling rate. Based on what it was mentioned in the class, we randomly pick features in each split. We use a more general approach here to make the programming part easier. Let’s randomly pick some features (70% percent of features) and grow the tree based on the pre-determined randomly selected features. Therefore, there is no need to find random features in each split.

c) Fit a decision tree to the subsample of data we’ve chosen to a certain depth.

Classification for a random forest is then done by taking a majority vote of the classifications yielded by each tree in the forest after it classifies an example.

In RandomForest Class,

1. X is assumed to be a matrix with num_training rows and num_features columns where num_training is the number of total records and num_features is the number of features of each record.

2. y is assumed to be a vector of labels of length num_training.

NOTE: Lookout for TODOs for the parts that needs to be implemented.

3.2 Hyperparameter Tuning with a Random Forest (5pts) **[P]**

In machine learning, hyperparameters are parameters that are set before the learning process begins. The max_depth, num_estimators, or max_features variables from 3.1 are examples of different hyperparameters for a random forest model. In this section, you will tune your random forest model on an e-commerce dataset to achieve a high accuracy on a classifying revenue sessions (whether a customer will purchase a product) from user behavior.

Let’s first review the dataset in a bit more detail.

Dataset Objective

Imagine that we are doctors working on a cure for heart disease by using machine learning to categorize patients. We know that narrowing arteries are an early indicator of disease. We are tasked with the responsibility of coming up with a method for determining the likelihood of patient having narrowing arteries. We will then use this information to decide which patients to run further tests on for treatment.

After much deliberation amongst the team, you come to a conclusion that we can use past patient data to predict the future occurence of disease.

We will use our random forest algorithm from Q3.1 to predict if a pateient may have indicators of heart disease.

You can find more information on the dataset here (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/heart+disease).

In the following codeblock, train your random forest model with different values for max_depth, n_estimators, or max_features and evaluate each model on the held-out test set. Try to choose a combination of hyperparameters that maximizes your prediction accuracy on the test set (aim for 75%+). Once you are satisfied with your chosen parameters, change the default values for max_depth, n_estimators, and max_features in the init function of your RandomForest class in random_forest.py to your chosen values, and then submit this file to Gradescope. You must achieve at least a 75% accuracy against the test set in Gradescope to receive full credit for this section.

3.3 Plotting Feature Importance (5pts) **[W]**

While building tree-based models, it’s common to quantify how well splitting on a particular feature in a decision tree helps with predicting the target label in a dataset. Machine learning practicioners typically use “Gini importance”, or the (normalized) total reduction in entropy brought by that feature to evaluate how important that feature is for predicting the target variable.

Gini importance is typically calculated as the reduction in entropy from reaching a split in a decision tree weighted by the probability of reaching that split in the decision tree. Sklearn internally computes the probability for reaching a split by finding the total number of samples that reaches it during the training phase divided by the total number of samples in the dataset. This weighted value is our feature importance.

Let’s think about what this metric means with an example. A high probabiity of reaching a split on “Age” in a decision tree trained on our patient dataset (many samples will reach this split for a decision) and a large reduction in entropy from splitting on “Age” will result in a high feature importance value for “Age”. This could mean “Age” is a very important feature for predicting a patients probability of disease. On the other hand, a low probability of reaching a split on “Cholesterol (chol)” in a decision tree (few samples will reach this split for a decision) and a low reduction in entropy from splitting on “Cholesterol (chol)” will result in a low feature importance value. This could mean “Cholesterol (chol)” is not a very informative feature for predicting a patients probability of disease in our decision tree. Thus, the higher the feature importance value, the more important the feature is to predicting the target label.

Fortunately for us, fitting a sklearn.DecisionTreeClassifier to a dataset auomatically computes the Gini importance for every feature in the decision tree and stores these values in a featureimportances variable. Review the docs for more details on how to access this variable (https://scikitlearn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeClassifier.html#sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeClassifier.fe

In the function below, display a bar plot that shows the feature importance values for at least one decision tree in your tuned random forest from Q3.2, and briefly comment on whether any features have noticeably higher / or lower importance weights than others. [Note that there isn’t a “correct” answer here. We simply want you to investigate how different features in your random forest contribute to predicting the target variable]. Trestbps, CP and age seem to be important, probably because older people are more likely to get sick.

Moreover, chest pain type and resting blood pressure reflect the health level of patients, which is closely related to whether they are ill or not.

4: SVM (30 Pts) **[W]** **[P]**

4.1 Fitting an SVM classifier by hand (20 Pts) **[W]**

Consider a dataset with the following points in 2-dimensional space:

𝑥1 𝑥2 𝑦

0 0 -1

0 2 -1

2 0 -1

2 2 1

4 0 1

4 4 1

Here, 𝑥1 and 𝑥2 are features and 𝑦 is the label.

The max margin classifier has the formulation,

min ||𝜃||2

𝑠. 𝑡. 𝑦𝑖(𝐱𝐢𝜃 + 𝑏) ≥ 1 ∀ 𝑖

Hint: 𝐱𝐢 are the suppport vectors. Margin is equal to 1 and full margin is equal to 2 . You might find it

||𝜃|| ||𝜃||

useful to plot the points in a 2D plane.

(1) Are the points linearly separable? Does adding the point 𝐱 = (4, 2), 𝑦 = 0 change the separability? (2 pts) The points are linearly separable. If adding the point 𝐱 = (4, 2), 𝑦 = 0 the points will change to nonlinearseparable.

(2) According to the max-margin formulation, find the separating hyperplane. (4 pts) The separating hyperplane is 𝑥1+𝑥2−3 = 0.

(3) Find a vector parallel to the optimal vector 𝜃. (4 pts)

A vector parallel to the optimal vector 𝜃 : .

(4) Calculate the value of the margin achieved by this 𝜃? (4 pts) The value of the margin achieved by this 𝜃: 1/||𝜃|| = 1/2

(5) Solve for 𝜃, given that the margin is equal to 1/||𝜃||. (4 pts) 𝜃 = (1, 1)

(6) If we remove one of the points from the original data the SVM solution might change. Find all such pointswhich change the solution. (2 pts)

All such points: (0,2), (2,0), (2,2), (4,0)

4.2 Feature Mapping (10 Pts) **[P]**

Let’s look at a dataset where the datapoint can’t be classified with a good accuracy using a linear classifier. Run the below cell to generate the dataset.

We will also see what happens when we try to fit a linear classifier to the dataset.

We can see that we need a non-linear boundary to be able to successfully classify data in this dataset. By mapping the current feature x to a higher space with more features, linear SVM could be performed on the features in the higher space to learn a non-linear decision boundary. In the function below add additional features which can help classify in the above dataset. After creating the additional features use code in the further cells to see how well the features perform on the test set.

Note: You should get an accuracy above 95%

Hint: Think of the shape of the decision boundary that would best separate the above points. What additional features could help map the linear boundary to the non-linear one? Look at this

(https://xavierbourretsicotte.github.io/Kernel_feature_map.html) for a detailed analysis of doing the same for points separable with a circular boundary
